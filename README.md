# drop_ir_cal
This project is an analysis/characterization of the Melexis MLX90614 (versions DCH, BCF, DCI) IR sensors for integration into the NCAR NRD41 dropsonde for measuring Sea Surface Temperature (SST). Of primary interest is to understand how well the sensors compensate for thermal gradients.

## Methods

### Initial testing
In the NCAR/EOL Calibration Lab, the IR sensors are set up in a custom 'jig' designed and built by DFS for the custom blackbody insert. The blackbody is installed in the Fluke 7040 oil bath and set to 25°C to limit the influence of the ambient room temperature on the test. Three data streams are setup: from the IR sensor itself (controlled and captured by the Melexis evaluation board), from the four thermistors attached to the blackbody (controlled by the Wisard board and captured by the lab computer, and from the Fluke 1594A Super-thermometer/5699 SPRT probe (captured by the lab computer).

Once the bath temperature has stabilized, data is collected for ~1 minute. Then, the temperature of the IR sensor body is raised (need to experiment with integrated heater coil versus heat gun) for a moment (max 5 seconds). Once finished, the system is allowed to stabilize (~30 seconds). Next, three puffs of air are blown past the sensor lens (spaced approximately 5 seconds apart). After this, data is collected for another ~1 minute, before shutting down.

IR data is saved to PN_SN_IR_YYYYMMDDTHHMM at 8Hz. Thermistor data is saved to PN_SN_TH_YYYYMMDDTHHMM at 1 sample/2 to 3 seconds. SPRT data is saved to PN_SN_ST_YYYYMMDDTHHMM at 1 sample/2 seconds. All data is up/downsampled as needed to reach 1 sample/s. All data is merged into one data file organized by date-timestamp.
